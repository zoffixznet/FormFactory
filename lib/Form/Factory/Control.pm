Given a feature name, it returns the named feature object. Returns C<undef> if no such feature is attached to this control.

=cut

sub get_feature_by_name {
    my ($self, $name) = @_;
    return first { $_->name eq $name } @{ $self->features };
}

  if ($control->has_feature($name)) {
      # do something about it...
  }

Returns a true value if the named feature is attached to this control. Returns false otherwise.

sub has_feature {
    my ($self, $name) = @_;
    return 1 if $self->get_feature_by_name($name);
